# CTS.JS

This package is a *very* loose port of the CTS URN notation as described by [Neel Smith](https://github.com/neelsmith) and [Christopher Blackwell](https://github.com/Eumaeus) in the CITE Architecture [Overview of the CTS URN Notation](http://cite-architecture.github.io/ctsurn/overview/). It is intended only to be a pragmatic transitional layer for presentational purposes of the texts in the repositories handled by this package.

For more information about the CITE Architecture, please visit the [CITE architecture website](http://cite-architecture.github.io/).
